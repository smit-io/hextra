The fork ships a development workflow on top of upstream's npm scripts: a self-documenting **Makefile**, a Docker Compose–based **devcontainer** with an always-on preview server, and helpers for **syncing with upstream**.

<!--more-->

## Makefile

Run `make help` for the full annotated list. The important targets, by workflow:

### Developing

| Target           | What it does                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make dev`       | Dev server with the full theme pipeline (writes `hugo_stats.json` on every rebuild)     |
| `make serve`     | Dev server without the theme pipeline — faster startup when you're only editing content |
| `make stats`     | Regenerate `docs/hugo_stats.json` (the class inventory Tailwind tree-shakes against)    |
| `make css`       | Compile production CSS — regenerates stats first, so it's always correct                |
| `make css-watch` | Recompile CSS on change; run alongside `make dev`                                       |

### Writing content

| Target                                 | What it does                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make new-blog NAME=my-post`           | Scaffold a blog post (`docs/content/blog/my-post.md`) as a draft, with tags, excerpt marker, and commented author/cover/pinned fields |
| `make new-doc NAME=guide/my-page`      | Scaffold a docs page with title and tags; `weight` left commented for manual placement                                                |
| `make new-doc-auto NAME=guide/my-page` | Like `new-doc`, but `weight` is set automatically to one past the section's last page                                                 |
| `make new-page NAME=showcase/thing`    | Scaffold any page under `docs/content/` via the default archetype                                                                     |

### Building & previewing

| Target         | What it does                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make build`   | Full production build into `docs/public` (compiles CSS first), drafts excluded — what ships                                 |
| `make preview` | Production build **including drafts**, served by the always-on preview container at [localhost:8043](http://localhost:8043) |

### Testing

| Target                            | What it does                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make test`                       | Full Playwright suite against a fresh draft-free production build                                                                         |
| `make test-a11y`                  | Accessibility tests only (WCAG 2.2 AA)                                                                                                    |
| `make test-mobile` / `test-build` | Mobile menu and build-output suites                                                                                                       |
| `make test-preview`               | Rebuild the preview (drafts included), then run the suite against the live preview container — what you tested is what 8043 keeps serving |

### Housekeeping

| Target                                     | What it does                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make fmt`                                 | Prettier over templates, CSS, and JS                                       |
| `make doctor`                              | Diagnose toolchain problems (Hugo/Node versions, stale binaries)           |
| `make reset`                               | Wipe and reinstall `node_modules` — fixes host/devcontainer binary clashes |
| `make clean` / `clean-stats` / `clean-all` | Remove build output, stats churn, or everything                            |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The dependency chaining is the point: `make css` depends on `stats`, `make build` depends on `css`. Upstream's raw npm scripts require you to remember the two-step "regenerate stats, then build CSS" dance ([why](https://github.com/smit-io/hextra/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)); the Makefile encodes it.
{{< /callout >}}

There is also an `npm run watch:css` script (fork-only) mirroring `make css-watch` for those who prefer npm.

## Content scaffolding

The `new-*` targets wrap `hugo new`, so front matter comes from the archetypes in `docs/archetypes/` (`blog.md`, `docs.md`, `docs-weighted.md`, `default.md`) and an existing file is refused rather than overwritten. `NAME` works with or without the `.md` extension, and nested paths are fine (`NAME=guide/deep/page`).

Details worth knowing:

- **Blog posts start as drafts** (`draft: true`): visible on `1313` and `8043`, excluded from `make build` until the flag is removed.
- **`new-doc-auto` computes `weight`** by scanning the target folder's existing pages at creation time and adding one past the highest. Draft siblings are not counted, and spaced weight conventions (10, 20, 30…) yield 31, not 40.
- **English only** — translated variants (`.fa.md`, `.ja.md`, `.zh-cn.md`) are copied manually alongside, matching the existing content layout.

## Devcontainer

Upstream uses a plain devcontainer image. The fork runs the devcontainer under **Docker Compose** (`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`) with two services:

- **`dev`** — the Go devcontainer image your editor attaches to, with the repo mounted at `/workspaces/hextra`. Devcontainer features install Hugo Extended (pinned version) and Node 22; `postCreateCommand` runs `npm install` so the container is build-ready on first open. A curated set of VS Code extensions (Tailwind, Hugo, Prettier, Git Graph, …) comes preconfigured.
- **`preview`** — a tiny (~258 kB) static file server (`pierrezemb/gostatic`) that serves `docs/public` read-only, with `Cache-Control: no-store` so you never debug a stale page. It starts with the dev container and stays up: re-running `make build` (or `make preview`) updates the served site with no container restart.

`devcontainer-lock.json` is tracked for reproducible tool versions. `.vscode/hextra.code-snippets` is picked up automatically in both the container and a plain host checkout — see [VS Code Snippets](vscode-snippets).

A named volume masks `node_modules` inside the container, so the container keeps its own Linux-native npm binaries (e.g. `lightningcss`) while the host keeps macOS ones — running `npm install` on one side no longer breaks the other.

### Ports

Both ports are auto-forwarded to the host (`forwardPorts` in `devcontainer.json`):

| Port   | Service                                     | What you get                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `1313` | Hugo dev server (`make dev` / `make serve`) | Live-reloading development build                 |
| `8043` | Always-on `preview` container               | The last **production** build from `docs/public` |

The split matters: `1313` gives fast live rebuilds, while `8043` shows the production build — minified, garbage-collected, tree-shaken CSS. Both include drafts (`make preview` passes `-D` so unpublished posts can be checked in production form); only `make build` output is draft-free. Check `8043` before releasing.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
`make test` and `make build` bake the config's `baseURL` into `docs/public`, so after either, the preview at `8043` serves a build whose absolute URLs point elsewhere. Re-run `make preview` to restore it — or use `make test-preview`, which tests the preview build itself and leaves `8043` correct. Inside the devcontainer, `test-preview` reaches the container as `http://preview:8043` (the compose service name); on a host checkout, override with `PREVIEW_TEST_URL=http://localhost:8043`.

### Typical workflow

{{% steps %}}

### Open in container

VS Code → "Reopen in Container". First open installs Hugo, Node, and npm dependencies automatically.

### Develop

`make dev` and iterate at [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313). Run `make css-watch` alongside when editing styles.

### Verify the production build

`make preview` builds for production and the result is immediately live at [localhost:8043](http://localhost:8043) — no server restart, the preview container just serves the refreshed files.

## Local CI with act

The repository's GitHub Actions workflows can run locally in Docker via [act](https://nektosact.com), so a PR's checks can be exercised before pushing. Defaults live in `.actrc` (runner image, amd64 architecture for Apple Silicon, container reuse); the Makefile wraps the invocations:

| Target           | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make ci-dry`    | Dry run of every workflow (`act -n`): walks the job graph and prints each step without starting containers — validates workflow syntax and wiring in seconds, no image pull                        |
| `make ci`        | Runs every workflow that triggers on `pull_request` — accessibility, build output, and mobile menu — exactly as a PR would, one job container each                                                 |
| `make ci-a11y`   | The accessibility workflow (`test-accessibility.yml`): production build, then axe-core WCAG 2.2 AA checks over every English page                                                                  |
| `make ci-build`  | The build-output workflow (`test-build.yml`): production build, then the asciidoc, render-link, and search-data assertions                                                                         |
| `make ci-mobile` | The mobile menu workflow (`test-mobile-menu.yml`): production build, then the Playwright mobile navigation suite                                                                                   |
| `make ci-pages`  | The **build** job of the Pages deployment (`pages.yml`) — verifies the site builds the way GitHub Pages builds it. The deploy job is excluded: it needs GitHub's OIDC token and cannot run locally |

Every target checks that act is installed (`brew install act`) and Docker is running before starting.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The first run is slow: act pulls a ~2 GB runner image, and the workflows download Hugo and Playwright browsers inside the job container. `.actrc` sets `--reuse`, which keeps the job containers between runs — repeat runs skip all of that. Remove the `act-*` containers to start fresh.
{{< /callout >}}

Workflow steps that upload test reports (`actions/upload-artifact`) talk to a local artifact server act starts itself (`--artifact-server-path` in `.actrc`); uploaded artifacts land under `/tmp/act-artifacts`.

Inside the devcontainer, the act CLI and the Docker CLI are preinstalled (devcontainer features) and the host's Docker socket is mounted. Note that act's job containers then run as **siblings** on the host daemon, not nested — bind mounts must resolve on the host, so running `make ci` from a host checkout is the reliable path; treat in-container act as best-effort.

## Syncing with upstream

The fork adds two Makefile targets for tracking [imfing/hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra):

### `make sync-setup`

One-time wiring: adds the `upstream` remote, fetches tags, and creates an `upstream-main` branch as a **fast-forward-only mirror** of `upstream/main`. Never commit to it.

### `make sync-status`

Shows current drift — commits behind/ahead of upstream, the latest upstream tag — and prints the list of **fork-owned files** that are expected to conflict on every merge:

- `assets/css/styles.css` — accent/light/dark palettes
- `assets/css/fonts.css` and `layouts/_partials/google-fonts.html` — fork-only Google Fonts
- `assets/css/components/*.css` and `layouts/_partials/*.html` — accent theming
- `static/icons/` — favicon reorg
- `.devcontainer/`, `Makefile` — fork-only tooling

### Sync workflow

{{% steps %}}

### Merge one release tag at a time

Merge `v0.x.y` tags individually rather than jumping straight to `upstream/main` — conflicts stay small and each merge is testable.

### Resolve conflicts toward the fork's tokens

When upstream adds new components, apply the accent/palette tokens to them as part of the merge (see the fork's history: "Apply accent theming to upstream's new components").

### Regenerate, don't merge, build artifacts

`assets/css/compiled/main.css` and `docs/hugo_stats.json` are generated files. Never hand-resolve conflicts in them — take either side, then run `make css` to regenerate.
