title: Gist
---

A built-in component to embed a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com).

The gist is fetched from the GitHub API when the site is built and rendered
with the theme's own code block, so it looks like the rest of your code and the
page loads no third-party script.

## Example

{{< gist id="94b164ef15167487a559285cee5bce93" >}}

Comments are highlighted like any other token, and lines can be called out with
`hl_lines` — here the five-line refill block and the early return:

{{< gist id="bfa237434f4a709c07c027e69fe57d6e" hl_lines="34-38 43" lineNos=true >}}

## Usage

```
{{</* gist id="94b164ef15167487a559285cee5bce93" */>}}
{{</* gist id="bfa237434f4a709c07c027e69fe57d6e" hl_lines="34-38 43" lineNos=true */>}}
{{</* gist id="2052694" file="README.md" */>}}
```

The positional form Blowfish uses also works:

```
{{</* gist "octocat" "6cad326836d38bd3a7ae" "hello_world.rb" */>}}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Required. The gist id — the hex string at the end of its URL. |
| `file` | Render only this file from the gist. Without it, every file is shown. |
| `hl_lines` | Lines to highlight, e.g. `34-38 43`. Ranges and single lines, space separated. |
| `lineNos` | Show line numbers. Default `false`. |
| `lineNoStart` | First line number. Default `1`. |
| `user` | The gist owner. Accepted for compatibility with Blowfish; the API does not need it. |
| `live` | Re-fetch each file in the reader's browser and refresh it if the gist changed. Default `false`. |

A gist carries no highlighting metadata of its own, so `hl_lines` is given at
the call site rather than in the gist — unlike a fenced block, where it goes in
the info string.

## Differences from GitHub's embed

GitHub's own embed script uses `document.write`, ships GitHub's stylesheet, and
renders nothing when scripting is off. Fetching at build time instead means:

- Chroma highlighting matching the rest of the site, in both light and dark mode
- The filename header and copy button of a normal code block, with a GitHub
  icon at the end of the header linking to the gist
- No request to GitHub when a reader loads the page

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  Every build makes one unauthenticated GitHub API request per gist, and that
  API allows 60 requests an hour per IP. A build with many gists, or a busy
  shared CI runner, can be rate-limited. A failed fetch degrades to a plain
  link and logs a warning rather than failing the build.
{{< /callout >}}

Very large files are truncated by the GitHub API. When that happens the visible
content is partial and the build logs a warning.

## Keeping a gist current

By default the page shows the gist as it was at the last build. `live=true`
keeps that build-time render — so crawlers, readers without JavaScript and the
printed page still see the code — and re-fetches each file when the block
scrolls into view, replacing it only if the gist has changed:

{{< gist id="94b164ef15167487a559285cee5bce93" live=true >}}

It refreshes from `gist.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<id>/raw/<file>` rather
than the API, one request per file. The `raw_url` the API returns pins a
revision and would never change, so it is deliberately not used.

Only files that existed at build time are refreshed. A file added to the gist
afterwards has no block to appear in, and one deleted afterwards keeps showing
its build-time content, since a failed fetch leaves the block alone. Both
resolve on the next build.

A file the API truncated is a useful side effect: the raw URL returns it whole,
so a live block replaces the partial content with the full file on first view.

`live` is mutually exclusive with `hl_lines`, `lineNos` and `lineNoStart` —
line highlighting is pinned to line numbers, and the point of `live` is that
the file can change underneath them. Combining them logs a warning and ignores
the three, so the block looks the same whether or not a refresh has happened.
Anonymous gists have no owner to build the raw URL from, so `live` is ignored
there too, also with a warning.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  With `live=true` the **reader's** browser contacts
  `gist.githubusercontent.com`, so the host sees their IP address. Without it,
  only your build machine ever connects. A restrictive Content Security Policy
  needs that host in `connect-src`. Pages using it also load about 126 KB of
  client-side highlighter, since Chroma cannot run in a browser.
