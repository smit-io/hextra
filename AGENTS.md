# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Hextra is a modern, responsive Hugo theme designed for creating documentation websites, technical blogs, and static sites. Built with Tailwind CSS, it offers features like full-text search, dark mode, multi-language support, and extensive customization options.

## Development Commands

### Initial Setup

When working in a new worktree or fresh clone without `node_modules`, run `npm install` first to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

```bash
# Start development server with theme reloading (recommended for theme development)
npm run dev:theme
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the example site
npm run build

# Build CSS assets only
npm run build:css
```

## Architecture Overview

### Hugo Theme Structure

- **Base Layout**: `layouts/baseof.html` wraps all pages
- **Specialized Layouts**: `layouts/docs/`, `layouts/blog/`, `layouts/hextra-home.html`
- **Partials**: Reusable components in `layouts/_partials/`
  - Core UI: `navbar.html`, `sidebar.html`, `footer.html`, `breadcrumb.html`, `toc.html`
  - Utilities: `layouts/_partials/utils/` for helper functions
  - Custom overrides: `layouts/_partials/custom/` for user customizations
- **Shortcodes**: Custom Markdown extensions in `layouts/_shortcodes/`
- **Render Hooks**: Custom Markdown rendering in `layouts/_markup/` for codeblocks, headings, images, and links

### Asset Organization

### Key Components

- **Search**: FlexSearch-powered full-text search (`assets/js/flexsearch.js`)
- **Navigation**: Responsive navbar and auto-generated sidebar
- **Theme Toggle**: Dark/light mode switching
- **Internationalization**: 20+ language support in `i18n/`

### Content Features

- **Shortcodes** (in `layouts/_shortcodes/`, grouped by what they do):
  - Layout and structure: `cards`, `card`, `tabs`, `tab`, `steps`, `details`,
    `accordion`, `accordion-item`, `timeline`, `timeline-item`, `filetree/*`,
    `borderless-table`, `hextra/*` (home page hero and feature grid)
  - Text and callouts: `callout`, `badge`, `lead`, `keyword`, `keywords`,
    `stat`, `stats`, `swatches`, `icon`, `ltr`, `rtl`
  - Links and actions: `button`, `cta`, `email`, `article`, `list`
  - Media: `video`, `youtube-lite`, `gallery`, `gallery-item`, `pdf`, `chart`,
    `typeit`, `asciinema`, `term`, `jupyter`
  - Code and content import: `gist`, `codeimporter`, `include`
  - Repository cards: `github`, `gitlab`, `gitea`, `codeberg`, `forgejo`,
    `huggingface`, `ansible`
- **Code Features**: Syntax highlighting (Chroma), copy buttons, line numbers via render hooks
- **SEO**: Open Graph, Twitter Cards, structured data
- **Performance**: Minimal JavaScript, optimized CSS with Tailwind

## Development Workflow

### Example Site Development

The `docs/` directory serves as both documentation and testing ground:

- Test new features here before releasing
- Configuration examples in `docs/hugo.yaml` showing multi-language setup
- Content examples demonstrate all theme capabilities
- Run from docs with: `hugo server --themesDir=../..`

### CSS Development Workflow

- Source: `assets/css/styles.css` (main stylesheet)
- Build process: Tailwind CSS → PostCSS → `assets/css/compiled/main.css`
- Component styles organized in `assets/css/components/`
- Chroma syntax highlighting themes in `assets/css/chroma/`
- CSS compilation requires Node.js dependencies (PostCSS, Tailwind CSS v4+)

#### Rebuilding CSS after template changes

Tailwind CSS relies on `docs/hugo_stats.json` to know which HTML tags, classes, and IDs are actually used in the built site, so it can tree-shake unused styles. When you modify layouts, partials, or shortcodes you must **regenerate `hugo_stats.json` first**, then rebuild the CSS:

1. **Generate `docs/hugo_stats.json`** — Run Hugo with the `dev.toml` config (which sets `build.buildStats.enable = true`):

   ```bash
   # Using npm (starts a dev server that writes hugo_stats.json on every rebuild):
   npm run dev:theme

   # Or a one-shot build using the raw Hugo command:
   hugo --config=hugo.yaml,../dev.toml --themesDir=../.. --source=docs
   ```

2. **Build the CSS** — With an up-to-date `hugo_stats.json` in place, compile the stylesheet:

   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

> **Why two steps?** `dev.toml` mounts `docs/hugo_stats.json` into the Hugo asset pipeline (`assets/notwatching/hugo_stats.json`) and configures a cache-buster so that changes to the stats file trigger a CSS recompile during `dev:theme`. When running outside the dev server you need to perform these steps manually in order.

### Releasing

`VERSION` at the repository root is the single source of truth. A push to `main`
that changes it fires `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which tags `v<VERSION>`,
generates release notes from the conventional commits since the previous tag,
attaches a source zip, and publishes the release. An ordinary push to `main`
only deploys the site — no release is cut.

The workflow skips silently when the tag already exists, so re-running it is
safe. Preview the notes for the current `VERSION` before bumping:

```bash
npm run changelog
```

This repository carries tags inherited from `imfing/hextra`; the changelog only
considers tags reachable from `HEAD`, so unrelated upstream tags never widen the
range.

### Customization Points

- Custom partials: `layouts/_partials/custom/`
- Custom CSS: `assets/css/custom.css`
- Site-specific overrides: Copy any layout to your site's `layouts/` directory

## Configuration & Requirements

### Theme Requirements

- Hugo minimum version: 0.146.0 (extended version required - see `theme.toml`)
- Go 1.20+ (as specified in `go.mod`)
- Node.js for CSS compilation (PostCSS, Tailwind CSS v4+)

### Key Configuration Files

- `docs/hugo.yaml` - Example Hugo configuration with multi-language setup
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration for CSS processing
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and build scripts

### Development Environment

- Default Hugo development server: Port 1313
- Development server runs with `--disableFastRender -D` for better development experience
- Theme development uses `--logLevel=debug` for detailed logging

### Multi-language Support

- Configure languages in `hugo.yaml` (supports 20+ languages including RTL)
- Translation files in `i18n/` directory (e.g., `en.yaml`, `fa.yaml`, `ja.yaml`, `zh-cn.yaml`)
- Example supports English, Persian (RTL), Japanese, and Simplified Chinese

## Theme Development Guidelines

### Hugo Theme Conventions

- Theme files in this repository override Hugo defaults
- Follow Hugo's theme development guidelines for compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations

### JavaScript & Performance

- All JavaScript components are designed to have minimal footprint
- Core JS components in `assets/js/core/`: `theme.js`, `nav-menu.js`, `code-copy.js`, `sidebar.js`, `tabs.js`, etc.
- FlexSearch powers offline full-text search (`assets/js/flexsearch.js`)

### CSS Architecture

- Uses Tailwind CSS v4+ with PostCSS processing
- Component-based CSS organization in `assets/css/components/`
- Compiled output goes to `assets/css/compiled/main.css`
- Prettier formatting for Go templates and code consistency

### Accessibility (WCAG Compliance)

All new features and UI changes must follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) at the **AA** conformance level. Key requirements:

- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<button>`, `<ul>`, etc.) instead of generic `<div>`/`<span>` where applicable.
- **ARIA attributes**: Add `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-current`, `role`, and other ARIA attributes to interactive components (menus, toggles, dropdowns, modals) so screen readers can interpret them.
- **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via keyboard (`Tab`, `Enter`, `Escape`, arrow keys). Manage focus appropriately when opening/closing menus, modals, and drawers.
- **Focus indicators**: Never remove visible focus outlines. Use the existing `hextra-focus` utility or equivalent visible focus ring styles.
- **Color contrast**: Text and interactive elements must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Verify in both light and dark modes.
- **Images and icons**: Decorative SVGs/icons should have `aria-hidden="true"`. Meaningful images need descriptive `alt` text.
- **Skip links and landmarks**: Preserve existing skip-navigation links and ARIA landmark roles (`role="navigation"`, `role="search"`, etc.).
- **Live regions**: Use `aria-live` for dynamic content updates (e.g., search results, status messages) so assistive technology announces changes.
- **Form controls**: Associate `<label>` elements with inputs. Provide accessible names for buttons that contain only icons.

When introducing a new component or modifying an existing one, verify it works with keyboard-only navigation and review the rendered HTML for proper semantics and ARIA usage.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- Test all changes in `docs/` before releasing
- Use `npm run dev:theme` for theme development with hot reloading
- Format with `make fmt` before committing (`make fmt-check` verifies without writing)
- Prettier formats 161 of 186 templates, plus CSS, JS and Markdown. Two things
  make that safe: `.prettierrc` sets a very large `printWidth` for `*.html`,
  because wrapping a tag's attributes lets the plugin put newlines inside an
  attribute value; and multi-line template comments use the no-trim
  `{{/* ... */}}` form, because the plugin splits the closing `-}}` of a
  `{{- /* ... */ -}}` comment onto its own line. Write new multi-line comments in
  the no-trim form, or on one line
- `docs/content/` is formatted too. Two content conventions keep it safe: a
  multi-line shortcode call closes on its last parameter line (`... >}}`), never
  on a line of its own, because a leading `>` is a Markdown blockquote; and a
  `{{% /shortcode %}}` closer gets a blank line after a list, or Prettier indents
  it into the list item. `.prettierrc` also sets `embeddedLanguageFormatting` to
  off for `*.md`, so Prettier leaves the shortcode examples inside fenced code
  blocks alone
- 25 templates are excluded, each with its reason in `.prettierignore`: a
  significant space next to a template action (Prettier deletes it), or a doc
  comment against literal HTML (no neighbour can absorb the whitespace). Do not
  remove those entries
- Verify multi-language functionality across supported languages

## Authoring docs vs developing the theme

This file covers **developing the theme**. For writing content _with_ it —
shortcode syntax, front matter keys, `hugo.yaml` params, the blog — see
[`skills/hextra/`](skills/hextra/), a self-contained skill package that ships
with the theme and is installable into any coding agent. Its shortcode and icon
references are generated from `layouts/_shortcodes/` (the authority for
parameters, via each template's `@param` and `@example` doc comments), with
`.vscode/hextra.code-snippets` supplying enum choices and examples and
`data/icons.yaml` the icon list. Run `npm run build:skill` after changing any of
them, or CI will flag the output as stale. The generator also reports shortcodes
whose doc comments have drifted from their code.

The repo doubles as a Claude Code plugin marketplace: `.claude-plugin/` holds the
plugin and marketplace manifests, whose `version` fields are stamped from the
root `VERSION` file by the same generator. Edit any other field by hand. Validate
with `claude plugin validate ./ --strict` before releasing.

## Working conventions

How changes land in this repo. These are the rules, not suggestions — a change
that skips them is a change that has to be redone.

### Branches and pull requests

- **One branch per change**, named for what it does: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`,
  `style/`, `test/`, `build/`, `docs/`. Two unrelated fixes are two branches.
- **Never commit to `main` directly, and never merge into it locally.** Land
  every change through a pull request, even a one-line one, even when working
  alone.
- This is not ceremony. `test-build.yml`, `test-accessibility.yml` and
  `test-mobile-menu.yml` all trigger on `pull_request` only — pushing straight
  to `main` runs _none_ of them, including the `build-skill --check` gate. A
  stale generated file once rode along through four pushes to `main` for exactly
  this reason.
- Stack branches when a change genuinely depends on an unmerged one, and say so
  in the PR. Otherwise branch from `main`.

### Commits

- Conventional commits: `type(scope): summary`, imperative, lower case.
- The body explains **why**, and states what was verified. A commit that changes
  rendered output says so; a commit that claims not to says how that was
  checked.
- Never commit with tests unrun or unread. "Ran the command" is not "read the
  result".

### Releasing

- `VERSION` at the repo root is the single source of truth. A push to `main`
  that changes it fires `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which tags `v<VERSION>`
  and publishes the release — so the release happens when the PR merges.
- Run `npm run build:skill` in the same commit, which restamps
  `.claude-plugin/*.json` from `VERSION`. CI fails if they drift.
- Preview the notes first with `npm run changelog`.
- Minor bump for a `feat`, patch otherwise.

### Verifying a change

Run everything in the devcontainer, not on the host:

```bash
make fmt-check   # formatting, without writing
make test        # Playwright: build output, mobile menu, WCAG AA
make build       # production build of docs/
```

- **Touching a template, shortcode or content file means verifying rendered
  output**, not just that the build succeeds. Build before and after to a
  separate directory and compare the HTML. Whitespace-only differences are
  usually fine; anything else needs an explanation in the commit body.
- Rendered-output diffs are noisy by default: asset fingerprints, `lastmod`
  timestamps, `wordCount` and the lastmod-ordered "Recently updated" widget all
  move when files are touched. Normalise those before concluding anything
  changed.
- Accessibility is WCAG 2.2 AA and enforced by `make test-a11y`. Its budget
  scales with the sitemap; a timeout there is a slow test, not a violation.

### Formatting

- `make fmt` before committing. It is safe now, but only because the things it
  breaks are excluded — `.prettierignore` records the reason for every entry.
  **Do not remove those entries.**
- `layouts/_shortcodes/` is excluded wholesale: its doc comments generate the
  shipped skill reference, and Prettier rewrites the `{{< ... >}}` examples
  inside them.
- Four Prettier hazards, all found the hard way, all still live outside the
  exclusions:
  - A multi-line `{{- /* ... */ -}}` comment gets its closing `-}}` moved to its
    own line, which Hugo cannot parse. Write multi-line comments as
    `{{/* ... */}}`, or keep them on one line.
  - Wrapping a tag's attributes puts newlines _inside_ attribute values. This is
    why `.prettierrc` sets a very large `printWidth` for `*.html`; it once
    rendered `aria-expanded=" false "` on 259 pages.
  - A significant space next to a template action gets deleted, fusing
    attributes or class names.
  - In Markdown, a multi-line shortcode call must close on its last parameter
    line (`... >}}`). A leading `>` is a blockquote, and Prettier rewrites it.
- CSS: `make css` regenerates `docs/hugo_stats.json` first and then compiles,
  in that order. Tailwind tree-shakes from that file, so a new utility class is
  dropped from the build if the stats are stale. Commit the regenerated stats
  alongside the change that needed it.

### Fork hygiene

- This is a fork of `imfing/hextra`. `make sync-status` lists the files that
  conflict on every upstream sync; sync one upstream release tag at a time.
- Regenerate rather than merge: `assets/css/compiled/main.css` and
  `docs/hugo_stats.json`.
- When porting an upstream patch, port it by hand rather than cherry-picking —
  the fork has diverged far enough that the diffs rarely apply — and say in the
  commit where it came from and what was changed.
